@Controller
public class UserController {

	
	//create a method that is responsible to open signup jsp file 
	//in controller class method name we can take as per feature 
	// like for login -> login() , for signup -> signup() 
	// in controller your method must return String 
	// in controller your method must mark as public 
	
	public String signup() {
		return "Signup"; // in the return we need pass jsp name that  we want to open 
	}
}

we will put our jsp in side views folder 
views folder we will create inside WEB-INF
WEB-INF we will create inside webapp
webapp we will create inside src/main folder 


how server knows what to load ? 
for that we need to create url 
same as servlet url 

here we don't have multiple servlet here we have methods instead of servlet 
so we will map our method with url pattern 


by default server search jsp inside webapp folder , but now  we added jsp inside 
WEB-INF/views , so we need to inform configuration and inform server that search
inside WEB-INF/views
