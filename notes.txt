@Controller
public class UserController {

	
	//create a method that is responsible to open signup jsp file 
	//in controller class method name we can take as per feature 
	// like for login -> login() , for signup -> signup() 
	// in controller your method must return String 
	// in controller your method must mark as public 
	
	public String signup() {
		return "Signup"; // in the return we need pass jsp name that  we want to open 
	}
}

we will put our jsp in side views folder 
views folder we will create inside WEB-INF
WEB-INF we will create inside webapp
webapp we will create inside src/main folder 


how server knows what to load ? 
for that we need to create url 
same as servlet url 

here we don't have multiple servlet here we have methods instead of servlet 
so we will map our method with url pattern 


by default server search jsp inside webapp folder , but now  we added jsp inside 
WEB-INF/views , so we need to inform configuration and inform server that search
inside WEB-INF/views

how to read data from form?
using bean 

how to send data from controller to jsp?
Model model 
--------------------------

validation 
1)spring boot starter validator 
-----------------------------------------


jee ->  
	1) mysql-connector.jar 
	2) DbConnection.java -> logic 
	
	
spring ->
	1) mysql-connector.jar -> pom.xml {mysql driver} 
	2) spring-jdbc jar -> pom.xml     {spring data jdbc } 
	3) application.properties -> username url password 




#dbconnection
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/spring23
spring.datasource.username=root 
spring.datasource.password=root

spring23 -> we need to create spring23 database 

------------------------------------------------


create database spring23;

use spring23;

create table users (userId integer primary key auto_increment,firstName varchar(30),email varchar(30),password varchar(30)  );


---------------------------
delete

	soft delete -> 
	hard delete 



users 
userId 	FirstName	Email 	password isDeleted  
1	x		x	x1		0{false} 
2	y		y	y1		0	
3	z		z	z1 		0

user want to delete user with userId 1 

users 
userId 	FirstName	Email 	password isDeleted  
1	x		x	x1		1{true} 
2	y		y	y1		0	
3	z		z	z1 		0



deleteuser?userId=2 

? is known as query string
